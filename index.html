      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve been a bit of an enthusiastic code junky for a few years now (although, I definitely would not say I am the Code Junky!). I’ve done several IT and Coding courses over the years but have mostly taught myself how to code - well, I’ve read a lot of books and online resources and lots of crash testing/debugging. However, I’ve mostly made a living from warehouse and factory work which I’ve really had enough of as it’s just not mentally challenging enough. So much so, that I’ve been driven to make a transition into web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently enrolled in Le Wagon's intensive Web Dev bootcamp. I'm eager to apply my new technical skills to build innovative web applications. I’m thrilled to be embarking on a career change to web development. I’m immersed in the bootcamp and loving it. I'm rapidly acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to become a proficient full-stack developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just prior to starting the bootcamp I was learning Python 3 from books and online resources. So, I was a little apprehensive when I found out I would have to learn another backend language - Ruby. But, I love it! Especially its chainability of methods - reminds me a little of jQuery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d say I’m quite passionate about technology and eager to contribute to the world of web development. Through Le Wagon's bootcamp, I'm gaining the practical experience and technical expertise to pursue a fulfilling career in this dynamic field.
